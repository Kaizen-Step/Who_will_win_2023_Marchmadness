st.write(""" ### Data Gathering     """)

st.write(""" In order to create an effective NCAA match prediction application, it is important to collect and analyze relevant data on the teams and players involved in each game. There are several sources of data that can be used to inform match predictions, including statistics on team and player performance, historical data on past games, and real-time data on current games. In addition to statistics, historical data on past games can also be useful in predicting the outcome of a particular match-up. Historical data can reveal patterns and trends in team performance that can be used to make informed predictions about future games. This data can be collected from a variety of sources, including game archives, sports news websites, and other online databases.

st.write(""" March Madness is a thrilling time for basketball fans all over the world. Every year, the NCAA men's basketball tournament takes place in March, and it is one of the most exciting events in all of sports.
The tournament features 68 teams from around the United States, all competing to be crowned the national champion. The games are played over a three-week period, with the championship game taking place in early April. The 2023 March Madness began on March 17, 2023, and one week into this season's tour, we gathered game match data from the last week's games played and tried to use this data for testing our model (not involved in training and validation tests).The following table lists the most recent 10 games that were played in the previous week.

We trained the model with various statistics and features using last season's data sets, then we used its weight for our new model and we began training the new model with weights taken from last season's data sets. To make the prediction more accurate, we divided the data sets from the previous season into conference and post-season matchups and March Madness matches.

st.write(""" NCAA matches played data sets are collections of data that record various statistics and information related to NCAA matches, such as team scores, team performance, and game outcomes. As there was no appropriate data set that includes NCAA games in 2023 when we first started looking into the idea, we searched the internet for websites that might have the information.Â  The [barttorvick.com](https://barttorvik.com/gamestat.php?year=2023) listed all the matches played in 2023 in detail, but unfortunately the site just presents the 2500 match results out of the 1131 NCAA matches played in 2023. Â  So we start scraping the site for each individual team and generate a list for all 363 teams that are involved in the NCAA's different conferences individually, then gather up all the information in one table and publish it into Kaggle for public consumption under the name ["Kaggle-kaizen step-NCAA 2023 All Match Result"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaizenstep/ncaa-2023-all-games-results). An example table for 10 out of 31 Huston's  games is shown in the section below. The type of match refers to whether it is a conference or non-conference match, and the venue is the stadium where the matches are held based on first team. the rest of the tables is the statistics of teams played in the specefic match which will be explained throughly in the following sections.
